**Page Replacement algorithms**
These are the algorithms that are used to manage virtual memory.
Here in this repo I have done 3 of these:
  (i)_FIFO_
     This algoritm is Known as "First in First Out" i.e when a page fault occurs it replaces the page that is the oldest
     page of the main memory or replace the page that has been in the memory for longest time.
  (ii)
